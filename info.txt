# MOST IMPORTANT THING

/*
    there are 3 groups of EXT interrupts
        EXTI0_IRQn - EXTI4_IRQn  -> 0-4
        EXTI9_5_IRQn -> 5-9
        EXTI15_10_IRQn -> 10-15
*/

/*
    TIM2 and TIM5 are 32-bits
    there are 12 others timers which have 16-bits precision
    decided to use TIM2 and TIM5 in main operation and other(16-bit timers) to each another stepper
    for z axis and y axis beacuse they do not need perfect precision
*/

/*
    there need beed a minimum pulse width, and a little delay after set of direction before first step

    for example for DM556M
    minimum pulse width is 2.5us
    dir must be ahead step by 5us
*/

/*

    The interrupts with higher priority have weights with lower numbers, 0 means the highest priority.

    Priority of interrupts [MOST IMPORTANT -> LESS IMPORTANT]
    - endstops [1, 0], no subgroups detailed, because there're equally important
    - uart, dma [2, 0], just little less important, because from here can be request pause or stop
    - stepper finish [3,0], less important, its everything ok
