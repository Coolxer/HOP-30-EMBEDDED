    TIM2 and TIM5 are 32-bits
    there are 12 others timers which have 16-bits precision
    decided to use TIM2 and TIM5 in main operation and other(16-bit timers) to each another stepper
    for z axis and y axis beacuse they do not need perfect precision

/* there need beed a minimum pulse width, and a little delay after set of direction before first step */
/*
    for example for DM556M
    minimum pulse width is 2.5us
    dir must be ahead step by 5us
